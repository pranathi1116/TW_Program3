Collatz Sequence
The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are: If n is even: n = n / 2 If n is odd: n = 3n + 1 For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 It has been proved for almost all integers, the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends at 1.
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
5
16
8
4
2
1
